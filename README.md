# AI_Lab3_MinMax
The project contains a Connect4 game and AI using the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning implemented in Python. It was created as part of the Artificial Intelligence course at Gda≈Ñsk University of Technology. The repository contains 3 "main" scripts: **ava.py** (Agent vs Agent), **avp.py** (Agent vs Player) and **pvp.py** (Player vs Player). Feel free to switch up board dimensions, agent types and agent depths.

Note: I am not the author of the game itself, just the artificial intelligence of the agents.
